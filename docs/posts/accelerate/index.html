    <p>A nation needs three key elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Energy production</li>
<li>Human capital</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else is downstream of these things. No food means armies marching on
empty stomachs. No energy production means no industrial capital. No human
capital means we're growing crops and installing wind turbines for nothing.</p>
<p>A simple question: has the per-capita demand equivalents of these things
decreased in the past ten years, or increased?</p>
<p>For ascendant nations, the energy portion of this has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use?tab=chart">increased, not
decreased</a>.
Such is the nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">the Jevons
Paradox</a>. For stagnant and
declining powers, the opposite is true.</p>
<hr>
<p>For <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy">Net Zero
policy</a> to work,
it has to cap all three of these things and eventually make the per-capita
amounts of agriculture, energy production, and human capital use reverse.</p>
<p>A cap on agriculture combined with an increasing amount of human capital results
in that human capital starving. A cap on energy production combined with an
increasing amount of human capital results in energy shortages. In the biz, we
call this "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response#Load_shedding">Load
shedding</a>". And the
less stated about the cap on human capital, the better: who wants to live in a
country where education levels are stagnant?</p>
<p>Regardless: caps on supply without caps on demand results in artificial
scarcity, and caps on demand are completely unfeasible without resorting to
a 1984-style surveillance state, and given Britain doesn't even have a way to
unify patient records between NHS trusts, it wouldn't work even if it was
desirable that it did.</p>
<p>It's time to move on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's look at proxies for the three basic elements.</p>
<pre><code>1. Agriculture -&gt; Land, crops, livestock, machinery

2. Energy production -&gt; Fuel extraction, fuel consumption, energy storage

3. Human capital -&gt; Food, shelter, physical safety, healthcare, education
</code></pre>
<p>How do we keep agriculture and energy production pace with the expansion in
human capital?</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at what we <em>shouldn't</em> do.</p>
<p>We <em>shouldn't</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pay farmers to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-lump-sum-payment-to-leave-or-retire-from-farming/how-to-apply-for-a-lump-sum-payment-to-leave-or-retire-from-farming">exit the agriculture
business</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent nuclear energy projects from happening because <a href="https://twitter.com/mlanetrain/status/1556381583585804291?lang=en">"it'll only come
online in ten
years' time"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep adding more human capital without considering the human capital use per
capita or productivity per capita. This requires more nuanced discussion
that just isn't possible in today's social climate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should we do instead?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encourage farmers to stay in the agriculture business. Make it easier for them
to increase farm productivity. Encourage productivity increases through
superior technology. If <a href="https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/498900">the Dutch can do
it</a>, Britain can do
it too. Make food cheap again!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build more energy production facilities. Cheap energy makes everything
possible. Build nuclear power stations in every postcode area! Not just
nuclear, either. Let there be a plurality of energy sources. The more the
merrier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aim to increase the productivity of human capital. Instead of just adding more
human capital units to the human capital pile, encourage people to pursue
life-long learning. We used to do this with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytechnic_(United_Kingdom)">Polytechnic
system</a>. The
internet allows people to educate themselves for free, but there is still
more to do here.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of housing has increased, while the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@newhomequalitycontrol/video/7043682965079084293">quality of housing has
decreased</a>.
Do you not want your
<a href="https://twitter.com/CrossDavidB/status/1548273039376203777">Deanobox</a>,
Anon?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, consumer electronics have decreased in cost to the consumer <strong>and</strong>
increased in quality. Compare an old cathode-ray box to a new 4K OLED panel,
compare an old Nokia to a new iPhone, compare a PlayStation 1 to a PlayStation
5.</p>
<p>Who would you want running the world: the people who made housing ruinously
expensive with paper-thin walls, or the people who made televisions cheap while
making the screens contain 36 times as many pixels?</p>
<p>Imagine if your house was 36 times as good. Imagine if your healthcare was 36
times as good. Imagine if your education was 36 times as good. Why aren't they?</p>
<hr>
<p>Cheap is better than free. Just because something could be free at the point of
use doesn't mean that there are no costs to production. Making something free to
the user simply means that the user will use it without consideration to cost.
Remember the Dogecoin <a href="https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/faucet">faucets</a>? Where are
they now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cheap &gt; free</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheap, though? I think we can agree on making things cheaper. The only people
who won't agree are the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">bagholders</a>. I don't see
anyone crying for speculators. Progress has its casualties.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You can climb a mountain</p>
<p>You can swim the sea</p>
<p>You can jump into the fire</p>
<p>But you'll never be free</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you think about it, acceleration is just thermodynamics. It's all just
thermodynamics. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-physics-theory-of-life/">Life is on fire, didn't you
know</a>.</p>
<p>The arrow of time goes in one direction. It never goes back. Deceleration is
really acceleration in decay. Regardless of how much it decays, it won't stop.
It will just creep along. Human growth is accelerating. Society must also
accelerate. Technology is one way to achieve that.</p>

<p>Acceleration is the highest form of charity.</p>

<p>If you want the future to be bright, you need to accelerate. Step on the
accelerator pedal with both feet. The future can look after itself.</p>
