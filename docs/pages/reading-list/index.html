<h1>üìö Reading List</h1> 
<p>Some recommendations. Some are books, some are websites, some are even comments
on websites.</p>
<img src="/img/scifi-1.webp" alt="Books"/>
<h2>Sci-Fi</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Permutation City</em>, Greg Egan (1994)</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about computation, simulations, and what you would questions you would
ask yourself inside a computed simulation.</li>
<li>Greg Egan's other work is also good. His <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/BIBLIOGRAPHY/Online.html">short
stories</a> are worth a read,
especially <em>Into Darkness</em> and <em>Dark Integers</em>. Highly inventive, one of
Sci-Fi's best Ideas Men.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dune</em>, Frank Herbert (1965)</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is still the best. Not all Sci-Fi has to have rogue Artifical
Intelligence or be set in a hellscape! I once heard this one described
as Philosophy in Sci-Fi clothes, and I'm not sure I can disagree with
that sentiment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Snow Crash</em>, Neal Stephenson (1992)</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly influential in the Cyberpunk genre. &quot;Metaverse&quot; as a concept came
from this book, which makes Facebook's adoption of the term somewhat
unfortunate given the plot.</li>
<li>Every member of the original Xbox development team was made to read this
book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Manna</em>, Marshall Brain (2003)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marshallbrain.com/manna1">Available online</a>, a nuanced take on
the proliferation of automation in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>After Life</em>, Simon Funk (2006)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/index.html">Available online</a>, truly
mind-bending. Brain in a jar, or is it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Missing Semester</em>, MIT's CSAIL (2020)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">Available online</a>. I give this to every
new graduate who starts working with me, because most universities don't
teach how to actually operate the machinery these days. I find myself
referring to it every so often.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Design Of Everyday Things (Revised &amp; Expanded Edition)</em>, Don Norman (2013)</p>
<ul>
<li>A great primer to cognitive design for someone who's used to sitting
on the back-end of a system. Someone I worked with recommended it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Object Calisthenics</em>, William Durand (2013)</p>
<ul>
<li>How to think of objects in Object-Oriented Programming.</li>
<li><a href="https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/">Available
online</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uncurled</em>, Daniel Stenberg (2022)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://un.curl.dev/">Available online</a>, a peek behind the curtain of the
one of the world's most widely-used open-source software libraries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hacker News sometimes creates banger comments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18896204">This post on simple data crunching
pipelines</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8902739">Bane on Scaling</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24397272">Most of my ideas and most apps out there are complete
garbage</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Masters Of Doom</em>, David Kushner (2004)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Doom</em> is one of the most influential video games of all time. It
pioneered the first-person shooter as a genre. The story behind its
creation is even better.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4">John Carmack's Lex Fridman</a>
is worth every minute of the five-hour listen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of
Steve Jobs</em>, Ken Kocienda (2019)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories from a designer on the first ever iPhone. Kocienda designed the
iPhone's smart keyboard.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04">This ColdFusion is also a good
watch</a>. The inside story of
how a device most of the civilised world is familiar with actually
happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Make Something Wonderful: Steve Jobs in his own words</em>, The Steve Jobs
Archive (2023)</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of Steve's speeches and writings, a peek into the mind of the
world's greatest tech CEO.</li>
<li>The typesetting of this book is absolutely gorgeous. Hard copies were
given to Apple and Pixar employees, but good luck getting one.</li>
<li><a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/book">Available online</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em>, Marshall McLuhan (1964)</p>
<ul>
<li>Marshall McLuhan was decades (perhaps even centuries) ahead of his time.
He understood very clearly that culture being constrained by the
medium of that culture means that you can consider the medium to be as
important as the message, the origin of the famous &quot;The Medium is the
message&quot; quote that he's so well known for.</li>
<li>Unusually for an academic, he made a good presence on television, if
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFwVCHkL-JU">this documentary</a> is
anything to go by.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Staring into the Singularity</em>, Eliezer Yudkowsky (2001)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184827/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity.html">Available
online</a>.</li>
<li>A proper think about when the singularity might be and why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
