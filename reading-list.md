<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>

- [Scott Alexander](https://readscottalexander.com/), very rarely a bad take,
and certainly zero poor-faith argumentation. Some highlights:
    - [Book Review: Seeing Like A State (2017)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/);
    - [Meditations on Moloch (2014)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/);
    - [The Goddess Of Everything
    Else (2015)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/).

- [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/index), a polymath, one of the most rational
thinkers alive today. Highlights:
    - [It Looks Like You're Trying To Take Over The World
    (2022)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5e9arCnbDac9Doig/it-looks-like-you-re-trying-to-take-over-the-world) - Clippy gone wrong.
    - [The Scaling Hypothesis (2020)](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis) -
    probably the only opinion on AI scale worth considering.
    - [My Ordinary Life: Improvements Since The 1990s
    (2018)](https://gwern.net/improvement). A rational antidote to doomerism.
    Things do indeed get better!
    - [Laws of Tech: Commoditize your Complement
    (2018)](https://gwern.net/complement). Everyone in tech should read this
    document. It will explain so much about the industry.

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

- [Cowboys and Pit Crews
(2011)](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/cowboys-and-pit-crews). I give
this to newbie developers on team. I like to re-read this every year. If I could
print it on parchment in a leather-bound book I would.

- [Staring into the Singularity
(2001)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184827/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity.html)
by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

- [The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past it?
(1998)](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html) by Robin Hanson. His ùïè is
also worth following. Why do we progress? Why do we push the envelope, and why
is humanity so alone?

- [Simulation, Consciousness, Existence (1998)](https://archive.is/uqCeA) by Hans
Moravec.

<h3 id="papers">Papers</h3>

- [Philosophical Aspects of Artificial Life
(1996)](https://people.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/ecal91.pdf) by Mark A.
Bedau. Essential reading for anyone interested in the subject of Artificial
Intelligence.

- Anything from [Papers for Software
Engineers](https://github.com/facundoolano/software-papers) is worth reading.

<h3 id="web-fiction">Web Fiction</h3>

- [Manna: Two Views of Humanity's Future (2003)](https://marshallbrain.com/manna1) by
Marshall Brain. A novella on what society could do with automation.

- [After Life (2006)](https://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk. A
sci-fi novella about artificial intelligence and conscience transfer.

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

- [The Steve Jobs Archive](https://stevejobsarchive.com/book). A collection of
Steve Jobs's writings and speeches. The ebook is beautifully typeset, too. They
did publish a book, but it goes for stupid money on eBay and isn't worth it.

- [The Little Book Of Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html) by
Fran√ßois Fleuret. A good introduction to Deep Learning for someone who knows
their mathematics. Otherwise, [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) is also good.

- [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/) by Balaji Srinivasan is very *of
the moment*. You may disagree with it (I certainly do), but because "people" are
aware of it, you should be aware of it too. Think of it as a tech bro's
rediscovery of pre-nation-state tribal structures but with WiFi and a
blockchain.
