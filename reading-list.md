<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>

- [Scott Alexander](https://readscottalexander.com/), very rarely a bad take,
and certainly zero poor-faith argumentation. Some highlights:
    - [Book Review: Seeing Like A State (2017)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/);
    - [Meditations on Moloch (2014)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/);
    - [The Goddess Of Everything
    Else (2015)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/).

- [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/index), a polymath, one of the most rational
thinkers alive today. Highlights:
    - [It Looks Like You're Trying To Take Over The World
    (2022)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5e9arCnbDac9Doig/it-looks-like-you-re-trying-to-take-over-the-world) - Clippy gone wrong.
    - [The Scaling Hypothesis (2020)](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis) -
    probably the only opinion on AI scale worth considering.
    - [My Ordinary Life: Improvements Since The 1990s
    (2018)](https://gwern.net/improvement). A rational antidote to doomerism.
    Things do indeed get better!
    - [Laws of Tech: Commoditize your Complement
    (2018)](https://gwern.net/complement). Everyone in tech should read this
    document. It will explain so much about the industry.

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

- [Cowboys and Pit Crews
(2011)](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/cowboys-and-pit-crews).

- [Staring into the Singularity
(2001)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184827/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity.html)
by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

- [The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past it?
(1998)](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html) by Robin Hanson. His ùïè is
also worth following. Why do we progress? Why do we push the envelope, and why
is humanity so alone?

- [Simulation, Consciousness, Existence (1998)](https://archive.is/uqCeA) by Hans
Moravec.

<h3 id="papers">Papers</h3>

- [Philosophical Aspects of Artificial Life
(1996)](https://people.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/ecal91.pdf) by Mark A.
Bedau. Essential reading for anyone interested in the subject of Artificial
Intelligence.

- Anything from [Papers for Software
Engineers](https://github.com/facundoolano/software-papers) is worth reading.

<h3 id="web-fiction">Web Fiction</h3>

- [Manna: Two Views of Humanity's Future (2003)](https://marshallbrain.com/manna1) by
Marshall Brain. A novella on what society could do with automation.

- [After Life (2006)](https://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk. A
sci-fi novella about artificial intelligence and conscience transfer.

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<h4 id="books-fiction">Fiction</h4>

<h5 id="books-fiction-sci-fi">Sci-Fi</h5>

- Frank Herbert's *Dune*, need I say more? I consider it the American answer to
*The Lord Of The Rings*.
- Greg Egan:
    - [Permutation City (1994)](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32699.Greg_Egan)
    - [Diaspora (1997](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora)
    - [Quarantine (1992)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156775.Quarantine)
    - [Distress (1995)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156781.Distress)
    - His short stores are also very good. *Dark Integers*, *Moral
    Virologist*, and *Into Darkness* are my top three.
    - If you can find a copy,
    [Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_(novelette)) is also highly
    recommended.
- Neal Stephenson:
    - [Snow Crash (1992)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61240297-snow-crash) is a classic.
    I argue that it surpasses even *Neuromancer* in impact, although Neal
    Stephenson can't end a novel to save his life.
    - [Cryptonomicon (1999)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon)
    inspired a generation of Cryptocurrency developers.
- Vernor Vinge is also very good. I'm still reading
[A Fire Upon The Deep
(1992)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep).
    - [Rainbow's End (2006)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102439.Rainbows_End)
    is also on the list.
- I also rate Robert A. Heinlein.
    - [Starship Troopers (1959)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers).
    Read the book before watching the film. The book is **vastly superior** to the film.
    - [The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress (1966)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/976973).
    **TANSTAAFL**!
    - [Time Enough For Love (1973)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58306840-time-enough-for-love)
    is one of Heinlein's mellower books.

<h5 id="books-fiction-fantasy">Fantasy</h5>

- Tolkien's *The Lord Of The Rings* is always worth a re-read.
- I catch a lot of flack for suggesting Ayn Rand.
    - *Anthem* is the best one. It's a robust defence of the individual, and in
    doing do it inspired Rush's [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5jwxrTqoEA)!
    - Don't bother with *The Fountainhead*.
    - *Atlas Shrugged* is a two-fingered salute to paper rationing and while it
    does hold some philosophical value, it doesn't hold much literary value.

<h5 id="books-fiction-others">Others</h5>

- Homer: *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*. Just find a good translation. I read the
E. V. Rieu translation when I was at school. Even better: find a good audio
book, because both of these epics were spoken, not written.

- *Beowulf*. My copy is in Crossley-Holland's *The Anglo-Saxon World* anthology,
along with *The Battle of Maldon* and *The Wanderer*. I re-read this every
Christmas.

- Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* and *The Secret Agent* are good reads too.

- Cormac McCarthy's *Blood Meridian* and *No Country For Old Men* are great, if
sobering, reads.
    - *Child Of God* is macabre. Battle it, and it rewards you.

- Everyone should read George Orwell's *1984* and *Animal Farm*.

<h4 id="books-non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h4>

- [The Steve Jobs Archive](https://stevejobsarchive.com/book). A collection of
Steve Jobs's writings and speeches. The ebook is beautifully typeset, too. They
did publish a book, but it goes for stupid money on eBay and isn't worth it.

- [The Little Book Of Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html) by
Fran√ßois Fleuret. A good introduction to Deep Learning for someone who knows
their mathematics. Otherwise, [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) is also good.

- [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/) by Balaji Srinivasan is very *of
the moment*. You may disagree with it (I certainly do), but because "people" are
aware of it, you should be aware of it too. Think of it as a tech bro's
rediscovery of pre-nation-state tribal structures but with WiFi and a
blockchain.

- Ditto above, everyone should read George Orwell. There's something in there
for every occasion.
    - *Homage to Catalonia* is his account of the Spanish Civil War. He was
    there and fighting. The crispest account of personal bravery in modern text.
    - *Burmese Days* details his days in Burma.
    - *Down and Out in Paris and London* are from his days tramping.
    - *Road to Wigan Pier* details his view on working class life.
    - *Politics and the English Language* is **essential reading**. It makes you
    think more, read things better, and write with greater clarity.

- If you're an engineer, chances are that you don't write particularly well.
[The Elements Of Style
(1918)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150655649-the-elements-of-style)
makes your prose tighter. Forgive the American-isms but its style on prose is
very effective.
