## Now

Last updated: <time>11/10/25</time>

This page shows what I'm doing currently. For more information on
Now Pages, see
[this page](https://nownownow.com/about).

### Work

I'm returning to the University of Essex to do a
[Master of Science by Dissertation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research).

The subject of my research is using pose estimation to detect behaviours
in livestock.

[Git for Graduates](https://git-for-graduates.pages.dev/) doesn't get much love
these days. If there was demand for it, I would start a print run.

### Play

I bought a 
[Yamaha XV950](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/first-ride-yamaha-xv950-review)
this summer.

So far, I'm loving it. Elsewhere in the world it was sold as the Yamaha
Bolt. 950cc of V-Twin makes for great fun on old Fen roads. My only complaints
are that it's a little bit low, the fuel light is a little confused, and the
air filter is right where my knee wants to be, but other than that, it's pretty
good. At the moment it's in the workshop having some suspension work done.

You may also bump into me if you're in the Cambridge area.
