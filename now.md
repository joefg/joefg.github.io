## Now

Last updated: <time>10/10/25</time>

This page shows what I'm doing currently. For more information on
Now Pages, see [this page](https://nownownow.com/about).

### Work

I'm returning to the University of Essex to do a
[Master of Science by Dissertation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research).

The subject of my research is using pose estimation to detect behaviours
in livestock.

### Play

I've been riding motorcycles. I used to ride a
[Lexmoto R66S](https://www.lexmoto.com/models/SR125-2-E55)
until I passed my full license test, at which point I upgraded to a
[Yamaha XV950](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/first-ride-yamaha-xv950-review).

So far, I'm loving the XV950. Elsewhere in the world it was sold as the Yamaha
Bolt. 950cc of V-Twin makes for great fun on old Fen roads. My only complaints
are that it's a little bit low, the fuel light is a little confused, and the
air filter is right where my knee wants to be, but other than that, it's pretty
good. At the moment it's in the workshop having some suspension work done.
