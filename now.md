### Work

I'm returning to the University of Essex to do a
[Master of Science by Dissertation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research).

The subject of my research is using pose estimation to detect behaviours
in livestock.

[Git for Graduates](https://git-for-graduates.pages.dev/) doesn't get much love
these days. If there was demand for it, I would start a print run.

### Play

I bought a 
[Yamaha XV950](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/first-ride-yamaha-xv950-review)
this summer.

Elsewhere in the world it was sold as the Yamaha Bolt. 950cc of V-Twin makes for
great fun on old Fen roads. My only complaints are that it's a little bit low,
the fuel light is a little confused, and the air filter is right where my knee
wants to be, but other than that, it's pretty good. At the moment it's in the
workshop having some suspension work done.
