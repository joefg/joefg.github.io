## Now

Last updated: <time>17/10/25</time>

This page shows what I'm doing currently. For more information on
Now Pages, see

### Work

I'm returning to the University of Essex to do a
[Master of Science by Dissertation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research).

The subject of my research is using pose estimation to detect behaviours
in livestock.

At the moment, I'm reading a lot of literature. I'm using the dataset developed
in [this
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511020301707) to
test some commodity pose estimators.

[Git for Graduates](https://git-for-graduates.pages.dev/) doesn't get much love
these days. If there was demand for it, I would start a print run.

### Play

I bought a 
[Yamaha XV950](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/first-ride-yamaha-xv950-review)
this summer.

Elsewhere in the world it was sold as the Yamaha Bolt. 950cc of V-Twin makes for
great fun on old Fen roads.

My only complaints are that it's a little bit low, the fuel light is a little
confused, and the air filter is right where my knee wants to be, but other than
that, it's pretty good.

At the moment it's in the workshop having some suspension work done.

### Read

[Driven by Compression Progress](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4360) by Juergen
Schmidhuber.

[Smart Agricultural
Technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/smart-agricultural-technology/vol/12/suppl/C).
Agriculture is a high-tech field now!

[Automated detection and quantification of contact behaviour in pigs using
deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511022002240) by
Alameer et al. My research is a continuation of this.

### Use

I now use [Starship](https://starship.rs) to build my command prompt.

[eza](https://eza.rocks/) is a pretty replacement for `ls`. It's worth it just to
be able to see file permissions in octal.

I tried [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) but couldn't get used to hyprland. Kept
the wallpapers though! I get most of what I want from either
[BredOS](https://bredos.org/) or [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/).
