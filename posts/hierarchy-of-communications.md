This is a summary of some advice I was once given by a high-rolling
decarbonisation consultant. I'm sure you've heard the phrase "Higher Levels Of
Communication" before. It comes from the leaked [*How to succeed in MrBeast
Production*](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/15/how-to-succeed-in-mrbeast-production/)
onboarding document, but he added a few things, and called it the *Hierarchy of
Communications*.

### Nuanced Communications

The salient point here is:

> Not all communication is spoken or written.

Most people get this wrong (and I do sometimes), so to be blunt: **there is a
hierarchy of communication** based on how much unspoken or unwritten
communication there is present in the medium.

Lowest form of communication: email or text message. Low effort, easiest, async
but not as complete. Text messaging loses a lot of nuance. **And unless both
parties acknowledge that there has been a communication, there has been no
communication**.

Middling form of communication: phone call. Middling effort and synchronous,
misses a little nuance, but takes effort, and it does interrupt proceedings
somewhat. It's acceptable if you are anticipating a phone call because you can
plan around it, but unless you answer phones for a living and have the right
setup to do that, it is somewhat jarring.

Highest form of communication: in-person. Requires planning, synchronous,
takes a lot of energy and a lot of effort, but misses no nuance and clears
things up massively. It's the best form of communication but it takes a lot
of effort and disrupts the day.

### Synchronous Communications

There is another way to think of this, and that's to think of communications as
being separated by their sychronicity.

Broadly speaking, if you can reply at your leisure with no expectation of an
immediate response, you are engaging in an Asynchronous communication. And if
you have to reply at short notice, you are engaging in a Synchronous
communication.

Synchronous communications require more effort than Asynchronous ones, which is
why booking meetings at short notice is frowned upon (except in extremis of
course). A good meeting requires preparation of minutes, a designated meeting
secretary to take those minutes, and all participants require time to prep some
notes.

Asynchronous communications on the other hand require much less preparation.
People can reply at their leisure once they are in posession of all the facts
and can make their case much more clearly.

Both have their place, and it's up to the initator to make a good judgment on
this.

### Why it's important

I wish people thought about their methods of communication more! Choosing the
right medium is as important as the topic being communicated. Being put on the
spot without full possession of required facts means the synchronous meeting
fails. Sending someone an async message and expecting a response instantly also
means that communcation fails. **Remember, unless both parties acknowledge the
communication, it didn't happen**.

I personally prefer async communications. That's why you likely won't find a
phone number for me unless you know me in person. Too many people rush straight
to the synchronous communications when an asynchronous communication would
suffice.

But there is a place for synchronous communcations. That place is for when more
nuance in communication is required. It's more work, but if this additional
nuance is required, then it's worthwhile provided all parties in the
communication are on the same page and discussing the same topic as equals.

In such a case, **asynchronous communications can be used to bootstrap
synchronous communications**. No Synchronous communications without an
Asynchronous discussion beforehand!
