## Sci-Fi

* *Permutation City*, Greg Egan (1994)
    - Think about computation, simulations, and what you would questions you would
        ask yourself inside a computed simulation.
    - Greg Egan's other work is also good. His [short
        stories](https://www.gregegan.net/BIBLIOGRAPHY/Online.html) are worth a read,
        especially *Into Darkness* and *Dark Integers*. Highly inventive, one of
        Sci-Fi's best Ideas Men.

* *Dune*, Frank Herbert (1965)
    - The first is still the best. Not all Sci-Fi has to have rogue Artifical
        Intelligence or be set in a hellscape! I once heard this one described
        as Philosophy in Sci-Fi clothes, and I'm not sure I can disagree with
        that sentiment.

* *Snow Crash*, Neal Stephenson (1992)
    - Highly influential in the Cyberpunk genre. "Metaverse" as a concept came
        from this book, which makes Facebook's adoption of the term somewhat
        unfortunate given the plot.
    - Every member of the original Xbox development team was made to read this
        book.

* *Manna*, Marshall Brain (2003)
    - [Available online](https://marshallbrain.com/manna1), a nuanced take on
        the proliferation of automation in society.

* *After Life*, Simon Funk (2006)
    - [Available online](https://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/index.html), truly
        mind-bending. Brain in a jar, or is it?

## Technical

* *Missing Semester*, MIT's CSAIL (2020)
    - [Available online](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). I give this to every
        new graduate who starts working with me, because most universities don't
        teach how to actually operate the machinery these days. I find myself
        referring to it every so often.

* *The Design Of Everyday Things (Revised & Expanded Edition)*, Don Norman (2013)
    - A great primer to cognitive design for someone who's used to sitting
        on the back-end of a system. Someone I worked with recommended it.

* *Object Calisthenics*, William Durand (2013)
    - How to think of objects in Object-Oriented Programming.
    - [Available
        online](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/).

* *Uncurled*, Daniel Stenberg (2022)
    - [Available online](https://un.curl.dev/), a peek behind the curtain of the
        one of the world's most widely-used open-source software libraries.

* Hacker News sometimes creates banger comments, including:
    - [This post on simple data crunching
        pipelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18896204).
    - [Bane on Scaling](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8902739).
    - [Most of my ideas and most apps out there are complete
        garbage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24397272).

## Cultural

* *Masters Of Doom*, David Kushner (2004)
    - *Doom* is one of the most influential video games of all time. It
        pioneered the first-person shooter as a genre. The story behind its
        creation is even better.
    - [John Carmack's Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4)
        is worth every minute of the five-hour listen.

* *Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of
    Steve Jobs*, Ken Kocienda (2019)
    - Stories from a designer on the first ever iPhone. Kocienda designed the
        iPhone's smart keyboard.
    - [This ColdFusion is also a good
        watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04). The inside story of
        how a device most of the civilised world is familiar with actually
        happened.

* *Make Something Wonderful: Steve Jobs in his own words*, The Steve Jobs
    Archive (2023)
    - A collection of Steve's speeches and writings, a peek into the mind of the
        world's greatest tech CEO.
    - The typesetting of this book is absolutely gorgeous. Hard copies were
        given to Apple and Pixar employees, but good luck getting one.
    - [Available online](https://stevejobsarchive.com/book).

* *Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man*, Marshall McLuhan (1964)
    - Marshall McLuhan was decades (perhaps even centuries) ahead of his time.
        He understood very clearly that culture being constrained by the
        medium of that culture means that you can consider the medium to be as
        important as the message, the origin of the famous "The Medium is the
        message" quote that he's so well known for.
    - Unusually for an academic, he made a good presence on television, if
        [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFwVCHkL-JU) is
        anything to go by.

* *Staring into the Singularity*, Eliezer Yudkowsky (2001)
    - [Available
        online](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184827/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity.html).
    - A proper think about when the singularity might be and why.
