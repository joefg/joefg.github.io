<div class="notice">
    ⚠️ <b>NOTICE</b>

    Much of the fiction I recommend is for adults, containing violence and other
    adult themes. I shouldn't have to put this notice here, but here it is.
</div>

**After Life** by Simon Funk, 2006. [Available
here](https://sifter.org/simon/AfterLife/index.html). A digital trip. No
description given. None possible. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**No Country For Old Men** by Cormac McCarthy, 2005. Requires no introduction.
You may well have seen the excellent film, you should make the effort to read
the excellent book. Viceless prose. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Permutation City** by Greg Egan, 1994. Think of copies of yourself in a
simulation. Treads more in moral philosophy at times. Very dry. Very innovative.
Worth the effort! ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Snow Crash** by Neal Stephenson, 1992. It's an upgraded *Neuromancer*, written
in a more amusing fashion, and in my view predicted the future better than a lot
of other Sci-Fi novels. The word "metaverse" came from this book!
Only missing a star because the ending was a bit unsatisfying. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Neuromancer** by William Gibson, 1984. The book that kickstarted modern
cyberpunk books. Think of cyberpunk, you're thinking of this book.
Missing a star because the writing can be a little bit dry. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**On The Road** by Jack Kerouac, 1957. Kerouac was one of the original Beat
Generation writers, named because they viewed themselves as beaten by a
consumerist, decadent society. I put it under Fiction even though it's a
roman à clef based on Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady's journeys across America.
★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Manna - Two Views of Humanity's Future** by Marshall Brain, 2003. A nuanced
view of what automation can do *to* humans, but also *for* humans. Discusses
many topics: brain-computer interfaces, the impact of AI and robotics on
society, different economic structures among others. Given four stars because it
is a bit technical in places. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**A Very British Coup** by Chris Mullin, 1982. A window into 1980s political
intrigue. Many predictions didn't come true. but some did. I don't usually
recommend political thrillers, but this is a good example of the genre.
The TV adaptation's pretty good too. Skip the sequel. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Cryptonomicon** by Neal Stephenson, 1999. It's a strange book set in two
time periods: World War 2, and the late 1990s tech boom. It's about a lot of
gold that was stashed somewhere in South East Asia. One group wants to sell it.
Another group wants to build an Internet Bank using this gold as a backstop
to their currency. Highly inventive. Required reading for Cryptocurrency and
Network Security people. Loses points because the author can't write endings
very well. ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

**Daemon** and **Freedom** by Daniel Suarez, 2006 and 2010. Written by an
engineer, the story of a dead man's AI curse unleashed on the world, highly
innovative, but mildly inconsistent at times. The author once gave a
[talk to Google employees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUEGzjnGsiA) about
topics and themes explored in *Daemon*. ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

**Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline, 2011. A love letter to video games and
1980s culture, set in a world so crappy that most people seek to escape it
through the OASIS, a virtual reality MMORPG. Interesting premise, but I'm
removing a few stars because of its reliance on 1980s culture. ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h3>

**Masters of Doom** by David Kushner, 2003. Incredibly well-researched book on a
games company called Id Software, which created the Doom and Quake franchises.
If you want to understand gaming culture, read this book. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Make Something Wonderful: Steve Jobs in his own words** by the Steve Jobs
Archive, 2023. Selected writings and correspondence from Steve Jobs, need I say
more? ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Homage to Catalonia** by George Orwell, 1938. George Orwell actually fought in
the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Republicans, for which he received a
gunshot wound in the throat by a Nationalist sniper, after which he escaped to
France after the Republican authorities arrested members of the organisation he
fought alongside. Moving accounts of personal bravery. A solid 5/5. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Gaia: a new look at life on Earth** by James Lovelock, 1979. This book changed
how I view the environment and by extension shaping the environment. Lovelock's
work on sensors paved the way to banning CFCs, allowing the Ozone layer to heal.
This book takes this thinking a step further by positing that the Earth can be
viewed as a self-regulating system. Controversial, but only to those who haven't
read the book well enough. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Down And Out in Paris and London** by George Orwell, 1933. It's a memoir of
how the poor truly lived, intended to show the middle and upper classes what
poverty is really like. Orwell actually gave up a post as a policeman in Burma
to write this book. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work** by Matthew B.
Crawford, 2010. Reading it made me realise how much I miss working with my
hands and convinced me to buy a motorcycle. If your mechanic had a PhD from
UChicago, he would write something like this. ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**The Outsider** by Colin Wilson, 1956. This book explores the concept of the
outsider personality, unwilling and unable to conform to the mainstream of
society. Uses a variety of sources, from Franz Kafka to Friedrich Nietzsche.
Interesting, but loses a few points because the author treats his own positions
on outsideness as self-evident truths. ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

**The Network State** by Balaji Srinivasan, 2022. A [free
book](https://thenetworkstate.com), it's an interesting read about how nation
states may develop in future using modern technology. It has a polarising
reputation because of the author's own personal leanings. I'm personally
interested in it because interesting people are interested in it, although I
found it a bit long winded at parts. ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>

**The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition: Your Journey To Mastery**
by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt, 2019. As one reviewer put it: "this book is
proof lightning does indeed strike twice". This book could replace most
University Software Engineering courses. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**The Design of Everyday Things** by Donald Norman, 1988. Explores
human-centred design. Introduced the term "cognitive load" into common
engineering parlance. Every engineer should read it. ★★★★★ (5/5)

**The Little Book Of Deep Learning** by François Fleuret, last updated in May
2024. Available [here](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html) free of charge,
although my hard copy stays in my laptop bag, and I keep a PDF copy on my phone
at all times. It does require a mathematical background to understand it.
★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Eloquent Javascript (4th Edition)** by Marijn Haverbeke, 2024. I like to
recommend this book to developers who have no code taste. I like to see
functional programming styles, and chapter 5 is a reasonable introduction to
that. Loses a couple of stars because it isn't that technical a document.
★★★☆☆ (3/5)
