*Aphex Twin* is an electronic Maestro, but *Orbital* is every bit his peer.
[Mock
Tudor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEjLyjVwkX4&list=RDMEjLyjVwkX4) shows
that *Orbital* can do just more than 4/4 time. I can't put my finger on it, but
if I close my eyes, this track brings me visions of a Virtual Reality or
Augmented Reality open-world environment in which I play a knight. Like
something in Daniel Suarez's
[Daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(novel)).

Current piece: A [Steelflier
VH60](https://www.steeldives.com/collections/quartz-watches/products/steeldive-39mm-vh31-quartz-watch-sf746).

It's a direct homage to the [Dirty
Dozen](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/dirty-dozen-twelve-military-watches),
but those were designed to War Office spec anyway so I don't feel too bad about
wearing a homage watch. I bought it as an easy-to-read
quartz watch for use on my motorcycle but after putting it on a [Marine
Nationale](https://thrifty-gentleman.com/blogs/blog/marine-nationale-strap-why-the-love)
strap, it became my new daily.

I'd love a [Vertex
M100](https://vertex-watches.com/collections/the-m100-series) one day, but for
now, this is sufficient. Skip the metal bracelet and bring your own strap.

My only criticism is that the subdial shows 24 hour time, when it really should
be a seconds dial to keep the main face clean, but I can live with this
particularity. The movement is a high-beat quartz unit that hits the markers
perfectly (certainly better than my Timex Q which cost more). The lume is
*excellent*, too.
