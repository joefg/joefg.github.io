My name is Joe, and this is my website.

It contains a humble [blog](./posts), and little else.

I am a software developer currently studying computer vision at the University
of Essex, my research area being in the use of pose estimation algorithms to
detect feeding periods of livestock.

For a more up-to-date summary of what I've been up to, have a look at the
[Now page](./now).

## Selected Projects

* [Git for Graduates](https://git-for-graduates.pages.dev), a pocket book on the
    effective use of Git. Sometimes receives updates.
