### Hello! 👋

My name is Joe, and this is my website.

I am a software developer currently studying computer vision at the University
of Essex, my research area being in the use of pose estimation algorithms to
detect feeding periods of livestock.

For a more up-to-date summary of what I've been up to, have read the
[Now page](./now).
