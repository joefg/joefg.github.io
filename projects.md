I wrote this guide after teaching some graduate developers how to use Git
effectively. Most universities don't teach it to the standard required in
industry, with many graduates being unable to distinguish between a merge and a
rebase in interview. This book is intended to be "everything I wish I knew about
Git when I was a graduate", a halfway between "just read the man file" and [the
excellent Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

This ebook is formatted to be easily readable on a phone screen during a lunch
break, and it is free, *forever*. I wrote it over a period of two weeks from
notes I put together. It uses `pandoc` to generate the PDF, and it is hosted
using a free [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev) account.
